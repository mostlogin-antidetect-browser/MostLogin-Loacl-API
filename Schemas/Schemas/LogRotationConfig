      properties:
        compress:
          description: |-
            Compress determines if the rotated log files should be compressed
            using gzip. The default is not to perform compression.
          type: boolean
          x-go-name: Compress
        localTime:
          description: >-
            LocalTime determines if the time used for formatting the timestamps
            in

            backup files is the computer's local time. The default is to use UTC

            time.
          type: boolean
          x-go-name: LocalTime
        maxAge:
          description: >-
            MaxAge is the maximum number of days to retain old log files based
            on the

            timestamp encoded in their filename.  Note that a day is defined as
            24

            hours and may not exactly correspond to calendar days due to
            daylight

            savings, leap seconds, etc. The default is not to remove old log
            files

            based on age.
          format: int64
          type: integer
          x-go-name: MaxAge
        maxBackups:
          description: >-
            MaxBackups is the maximum number of old log files to retain.  The
            default

            is to retain all old log files (though MaxAge may still cause them
            to get

            deleted.)
          format: int64
          type: integer
          x-go-name: MaxBackups
        maxSize:
          description: >-
            MaxSize is the maximum size in megabytes of the log file before it
            gets

            rotated. It defaults to 100 megabytes.
