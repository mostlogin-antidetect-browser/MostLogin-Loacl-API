# MostLogin-Loacl-API
MostLogin Local API supports Chromedriver/CDP-based automation frameworks (e.g., Selenium/Playwright/Puppeteer). It provides standard RESTful interfaces, supports high-concurrency calls without programming language restrictions. Documentation offers invocation examples in Python, JavaScript, Go, and 10+ other languages.
# The core value of this upgrade
We understand that multi-account management is not only a technical challenge but also the core defense line for business security. The newly opened API will provide you with:
Efficiency revolution
Creating/managing 1,000+ independent environments with a single API call is only required, and the deployment efficiency is increased by 10 times, eliminating the need for manual repetitive operations
Security reinforcement
Dynamic fingerprint engine modifies 200+ device parameters (Canvas noise/WebGL rendering/time zone language) in real time, breaking through the tracking of platform risk control algorithms, and the account association and ban rate decreases by 92%
Ecological expansion
Native integration of Selenium/Puppeteer and other automation tools, seamless integration into existing RPA workflows, and support for webhook callbacks to achieve customized business systems
