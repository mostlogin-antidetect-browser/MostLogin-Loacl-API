> ## The core value of this upgrade
We understand that multi-account management is not only a technical challenge but also the core defense line for business security. The newly opened API will provide you with:
- Efficiency revolution
Creating/managing 1,000+ independent environments with a single API call is only required, and the deployment efficiency is increased by 10 times, eliminating the need for manual repetitive operations
- Security reinforcement
Dynamic fingerprint engine modifies 200+ device parameters (Canvas noise/WebGL rendering/time zone language) in real time, breaking through the tracking of platform risk control algorithms, and the account association and ban rate decreases by 92%
- Ecological expansion
Native integration of Selenium/Puppeteer and other automation tools, seamless integration into existing RPA workflows, and support for webhook callbacks to achieve customized business systems
